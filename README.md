# Knight's Shortest Path

The Knight's Shortest Path problem asks the following: given a starting position and a target position, find a path with the least amount of moves for a knight on a chessboard to reach the target position. This problem was solved using a simple path-finding algorithm implemented in C for my Advanced Algorithms course.

I was just starting to re-learn C when I wrote this program, so it's not the most optimal, or clean, solution in the world. I may come by and update it at a later point in time.
